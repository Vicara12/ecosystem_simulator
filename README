                            ECOSYSTEM SIMULATOR

This program aims to recreate a basic ecosistem with a food chain.


        CREATURES

There are three types of creatures: plants, bunnies and foxes, some have the
hability to eat, drink, move, and be eaten, all of them can reproduce.

Plants:
    Plants can only repoduce and be eaten. They are the base of the food chain
    and serve as food for the bunnies.

Bunnies:
    Bunnies can perform all the activities, they can eat, drink, be eaten,
    move and reproduce. Bunnies eat plants and get eaten by foxes.

Foxes:
    Foxes are at the top of the food chain, they can eat, drink, move and
    reproduce. Foxes eat rabbits.



        PROPERTIES AND MECHANICS

Each creature has its own properties that dictate how they behave.



        MAP FILE FORMAT

The program accepts an input file to generate the terrain with. This file must
contain two numbers indicating the number of columns and the number of rows at
the beggining followed by the sequence of characters that forms the map. Each
character represents a chunk of map and can be either g for grass, w for water
or t for tree (all must be lowercase). If the quantity of letters provided is
incorrect, an error occours and program execution is aborted.
Map files can also contain creatures just by specifying -fc (file creatures) in
the program parameters. In that case, each criature has its own character:

    b: bunny
    p: plant
    f: fox

The chunk that the creature occupies will be filled with grass.
